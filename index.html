For the other outcomes, there was no difference between types of continuous support. (2012, Hodnett et al.)

                        The birth of your child is an experience that belongs to you and your family. A true doula will always encourage fathers and partners to take part in the birth to the extent they that feel comfortable and happy. If they want to be right there holding mama's hand, we will encourage them. A doula can suggest positions, comfort measures and other techniques for fathers and partners. This will ensure that mom is getting the care she needs and other family members can play an active and informed role.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted" style="width:370px">I grew up on a farm on Whidbey Island in Washington state. I am one of seven children. Birth was an aspect of life that I got to see first hand in nature, and on the farm. Needless to say, birth was always presented to me as a normal part of nature. As I got older, I loved supporting family members and friends in their birth journeys. When I realized this was something I could do as a profession I was ecstatic. I have found that women show their true strength and are deeply in tune with their instincts during labor. I love being a support for these magnificent women as they create their own miracles. I have been practicing yoga since childhood, and am always continuing my education. My education in biology and chemistry, along with my understanding of natural living and holistic health, allow me to have a unique and valuable perspective on birth and women's health.</p>

                            <blockquote>"Right away I knew that Laura loved being a Doula. She is very knowledgeable, sweet and really looks out for the mom. I had the best experience with her. She made me feel so strong, confident, and comfortable during labor. She's very encouraging. I still brag about her when I tell my labor story with others! If in the future I become pregnant again, she will be the first one I call! She is FANTASTIC!"
